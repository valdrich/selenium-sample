# About Selenium
Selenium helps you to automate your tests. It is focused for web applications and testing purposes, but not limited to just that.
You can also automate routines =)

Below you can see the architecture of Selenium.

As shown on the image above, you can perform your tests with several browsers, such as: Chrome, Firefox, IE, and so on. With these drivers, it is possible to simulate the actions, like a regular user does.

And that's how all the magic happen.
